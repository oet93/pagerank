# PageRank

This is a custom and simple Python implementation of the PageRank algorithm for academic purpose.

# Requirements

Run the following command for installing the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

The Python script creates a random graph with a random PageRank initialization. The refinement of rankings is performed
through the power method.
For executing the code, simply run:

```bash
python pagerank.py --plots
```

Different parameters can be modified for creating different graphs or obtaining different results with the power method.
To discover those parameters, just run:

```bash
python pagerank.py -h
```
